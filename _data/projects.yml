       I use many server hosting services and sometimes these services don't offer an easy way to integrate Discord, a popular modern IRC, to my projects. Those who do offer webhooks, oftentimes, only comfort to specific services such as Slack. Thus, leading me to create a simple Multidimential Array Parser and hook services.

       Discord Webhook Service was a personal project that servers the purpose of taking any 3rd Party Webhook (*cough* heroku *cough*) and parsing through it to shape to a compatible data structure Discord would accept.
