    The four long years of high school leave plenty of room to hone my skills, so I've been dual-enrolled in college for a collective 2 years worth of credits at the same time as my high school experience. Not only would this allow me to rapidly acquire high school credits but also score great experiences and a superior education.

    I took upon myself the task of furthering my career as a programer by taking courses such as COSN10, and by collecting a TestOut Network Pro Certificate.

    TestOut Network Pro proves skills in:

      • Cables and Connectors

      • Wired Networking

      • Wireless Networking

      • Network Connection Configuration

      • Network Services

      • Network Security

      • Network Troubleshooting
